In order to understand factors that may be preventing the Stellerâ€™s populations from resurging, NOAA collected aerial photographs and counted the different groups within the population. As part of a competition hosted by Kaggle, we developed Deep Learning techniques to automate the process. We experimented with both density counting and object detection approaches, but found little success. Part of the difficulty we had to deal with when approaching this problem was the scale of the data. There was over 100GB, where each image had a dimension of around 4000 by 3000 pixels.",
