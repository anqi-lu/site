In order to understand factors that may be preventing the Stellerâ€™s populations from resurging, NOAA collected aerial photographs and counted the different groups within the pop- ulation. As part of a competition hosted by Kag- gle, we developed Deep Learning techniques to automate the process. We experimented with both density counting and object detection ap- proaches, but found little success.",
